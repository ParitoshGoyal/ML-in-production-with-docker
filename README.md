# ML-in-production-with-docker

I have deployed text generator using pipeline module from huggingface. The text generator uses gpt-2 to generate responses. 
Generating responses is an important task in NLP, especially when building chatbots. This model can be further fine-tuned to generate more domain specific text.

For more details and to run the project in a docker container and access it using a web browser through a website, please refer to the django-docker folder and the readme there. The web app is fully reproducible.
